The goal of this project is to demonstrate an application that predicts
the next word when the users most likely want to type. This is the
capstone project for the Data Science specialization held by Johns
Hopkins University and partnered with SwiftKey. The main use case for
this application is text messaging on the mobile phones.

-   Given a word / phrase as input by an end user then the application
    will try to predict the next word.
-   The application contains the UI that allows the users to input a
    word or phrase and it is built with shiny app UI.
-   And this presentation is created as part of the requirement for the
    Data Science Capstone class.
